1. **.cer (Certificate) file**: 
This is a binary encoded X.509 certificate file, which contains public key data and attributes about the certificate holder. It is often used in Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) systems to verify the identity of a server or other entity for SSL/TLS secure connections.

2. **.pfx (Personal Information Exchange) or .p12 files**: 
These are PKCS #12 files, which contain a private key and one or more X.509 certificates in a single file. The primary difference between .pfx and .p12 files is the extension; they are essentially the same file type. These files can be used for both client and server certificate authentication, and are commonly used for code signing, email encryption, and securing network connections with SSL/TLS.

In summary, both .cer and .pfx/p12 files serve different purposes in a PKI system. A .cer file is only used to verify the identity of a server or other entity and contains public key data, while a .pfx/.p12 file includes both private key and one or more certificates, allowing for two-way authentication when establishing secure connections.
