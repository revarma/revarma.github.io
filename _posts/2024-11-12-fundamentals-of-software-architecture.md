# Key takeaways:
1. Software Architecture is dynamic, is a tradeoff and is an iterative process.
2. Architecture cannot be done at the beginning of an initiative and cannot expect it to remain constant during the development process.
3. New changes keeps coming and architecture should incorporate those changes and keep evolving while considering tradeoffs.
